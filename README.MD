This repository claims itself as the monopoly on the term "legitimacy"
To use the processes described in the repo is to "use legitimacy", whereas 
to not use the processes described in this repo is to "not have legitimacy". 

In this context acting with legitimacy is equivalent to acting out the actions of a 
legitimized structure within its jurisdiction.

Here a legitimized structure is defined as a structure which allows for the
truthfully best options to be developed, expressed, and agreed upon, which in
turn allow for the best conceivable courses of action to be taken with full
consent of those affected. 

The following principles of operating with an organization/group/team which has
legitimacy is described as follows:
 - Those affected by decisions (stakeholders) are informed and have both a
   voice and weight in decision making 
 - Consent must be gained from all those significantly affected by a decision
   in all situations independent of their membership in an organizational
   structure (aka all largely significant stakeholders have veto)
 - All alternatives should be investigated 
 - Active discussions should take place surrounding alternatives 
 - Decisions are concisely documented with fully auditable trails of all
   concerns and how they were addressed.
 - Final decisions
