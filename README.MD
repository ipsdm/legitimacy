# Legitimacy

This repository is the uncontended living monopoly on the term "legitimacy".
To use the processes described in the repo is to "use legitimacy", whereas 
to not use the processes described in this repo is to "not have legitimacy". 

## Contributing

To legitimize this repo's conception of the term "legitimacy" all aspects of all
this repo's content are fully contestable and subject to complete redefinition,
recreation, refinement, rectification, demolition, and obliteration as per new
insights gained through rational discourse. Absolutely nothing is off limits.

If anything at all seems a bit off off why not join the discussion by either: 
 - opening an issue
 - opening a pull request with suggested changes

## Contents

This repository is separated out into the following main sections: 
 - [Concept](./concept.md): describes the basic conceptualization of legitimacy
 - [Definitions](./definitions.md): listed definitions for reference
 - [Suggested Structure](./suggested-structure/): suggested structure and implementation path

## Lifespan

This repository is temporarily hosted and maintained within github. Ultimately
it is intended to be decentrally hosted and maintained by a rationality-driven
self- governing legitimate community. Deprecation is estimated to occur in
2020.
