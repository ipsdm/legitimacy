#### Agreement 
A statement which has been agreed upon by all members of an organization
according to the consensus process. In the context of this repository
agreements are considered to be binding and documented statements which other
decisions/agreements can be built upon. 

#### Consensus 
When all parties involved in a decision mutually agree upon a solution through
a process of rational discourse. Arriving at consensus is contrasted by a
standard voting which merely tallies account everyone's opinion but does
guarantee mutual agreement. The consensus process should:

 - openly consider and investigate all alternatives proposed by members
   involved in the consensus process. 
 - be concisely documented with fully auditable trails of all
   concerns and how they were addressed.

#### Contention
When an agreement previously arrived upon consensus is no-longer agreed upon by
all members, the text [in-contention] should be added in front of the contended
agreement. A renewed consensus process should be initiated around the contended
agreement whereby either: 
 - new consensus can be reached on either the unamended or amended agreement
 - The agreement is removed, or, 
 - The contending members exit the organization. 

#### Member
{TODO criteria for full membership}

#### Ratified 
When an organizational structure is considered to be affectual.
