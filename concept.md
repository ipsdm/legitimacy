## What is legitimate? 

Here a legitimized structure is defined as a structure which allows for the
truthfully best options to be developed, expressed, and agreed upon, whereby
the best conceivable courses of action can be taken 

with full consent of those affected. (how why?) 

The following principles of operating with an organization/group/team which has
legitimacy is described as follows:
 1. Those affected by decisions (stakeholders) are informed and have both a
    voice and weight in decision making 
 2. Consent must be gained from all those significantly affected by a decision
    in all situations independent of their membership in an organizational
    structure (aka all largely significant stakeholders have veto)

 3. All alternatives should be investigated 
 4. Active discussions should take place surrounding alternatives 
 5. Decisions are concisely documented with fully auditable trails of all
    concerns and how they were addressed.
 6. Final decisions
