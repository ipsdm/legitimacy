## What is legitimate? 

A legitimized structure hereby is defined as a structure which allows for the
truthfully best options to be developed, expressed, and agreed upon, whereby
the best conceivable courses of action can be taken. Core to the legitimate
action is gaining explicit consent of those significantly affected by actions
_prior_ to actions being taken (with the exception of self-defense). 

The following are principles of operating with legitimacy:
 1. Those affected by decisions (stakeholders) are informed and have both a
    voice and weight in decision making 
 2. Consent must be gained from all those significantly affected by a decision
    in all situations independent of their membership in an organizational
    structure (aka all largely significant stakeholders have veto)
 3. [Consensus](./definitions.md#Consensus) is the primary mode of decision
    making whereby new alternative decision making mechanisms can be utilized
    legimately after having been agreed upon through the consensus process. 
 4. _All_ previously made decisions and agreements are subject to change
    through the [contention process](./definitions.md#Contention).
 5. All agreements are documented comprehensibly and explicitly.
 6. Agreements are enforceable among those who've agreed upon them.
 7. All taken actions are non-malicious.

The above suggested structure is a baseline structure which arbitrary further
processes can be implemented within through further agreements. 

The suggested structure of a legitimate organization is provided [here](./structure.md).
